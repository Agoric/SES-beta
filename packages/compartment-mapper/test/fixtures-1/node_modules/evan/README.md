This package exists to verify that the compartment mapper follows symbolic
links to the original location of a package and looks up that package's
dependencies from  its real location.
In this case, `evan` is a symbolic link from `node_modules/app/node_modules`
and would not be able to find its own `node_modules/evan/node_modules/evankin`
if its dependencies were resolved from the link's location.
