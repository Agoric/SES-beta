# Secure EcmaScript (SES)

Secure EcmaScript (SES) is a frozen environment for running EcmaScript
(Javascript) 'strict' mode programs with no ambient authority in their global
scope, and with the addition of a safe two-argument evaluator
(`SES.confine(code, endowments)`). By freezing everything accessible from the
global scope, it removes programs abilities to interfere with each other, and
thus enables isolated evaluation of arbitrary code.

It runs atop an ES6-compliant platform, enabling safe interaction of
mutually-suspicious code, using object-capability -style programming.

See https://github.com/Agoric/Jessie to see how SES fits into the various
flavors of confined EcmaScript execution. And visit
https://rawgit.com/Agoric/ses-shim/master/demo/ for a demo.

Derived from the Caja project, https://github.com/google/caja/wiki/SES.

Still under development: do not use for production systems yet, there are
known security holes that need to be closed.

## Install

```sh
npm install ses
```

## Usage

### Lockdown

SES introduces the `lockdown()` function.
Calling `lockdown()` alters the surrounding execution enviornment, or
**realm**, such that no two programs running in the same realm can observe or
interfere with each other until they have been introduced.

To this end, `lockdown()` freezes all objects accessible to any program in the
realm.
The set of accessible objects includes but is not limited to: `globalThis`,
`[].__proto__`, `{}.__proto__`, `(() => {}).__proto__` `(async () =>
{}).__proto__`, the properties of any accessible object, the return values of
any accessible function, and the result of using any accessible constructor.

The `lockdown()` function also **tames** some of those accessible objects
that have powers that would otherwise allow programs to observe or interfere
with one another like clocks, random number generators, and regular
expressions.

```js
import 'ses';
import 'my-vetted-shim';

lockdown();

console.log(Object.isFrozen([].__proto__));
// true
```

### Harden

SES introduces the `harden` function.
*After* calling `lockdown`, the `harden` function ensures that every object in
the transitive closure over property and prototype access starting with that
object has been **frozen** by `Object.freeze`.
This means that the object can be passed among programs and none of those
programs will be able to tamper with the **surface** of that object graph.
They can only read the surface data and call the surface functions.

```js
import 'ses';

lockdown();

let counter = 0;
const capability = harden({
  inc() {
    counter++;
  },
});

console.log(Object.isFrozen(capability));
// true
console.log(Object.isFrozen(capability.inc));
// true
```

Note that although the **surface** of the capability is frozen, the capability
still closes over the mutable counter.
Hardening an object graph makes the surface immutable, but does not make
methods pure.


### Compartment

SES introduces the `Compartment` constructor.
A compartment is an evaluation and execution environment with its own
`globalThis` and wholly independent system of modules, but otherwise shares
the same batch of intrinsics like `Array` with the surrounding compartment.
The concept of a compartment implies the existence of a "start compartment",
the initial execution environment of a **realm**.

In the following example, we create a compartment endowed with a `print()`
function on `globalThis`.

```js
import 'ses';

const c = new Compartment({
  print: harden(console.log),
});

c.evaluate(`
  print('Hello! Hello?');
`);
```

The new compartment has a different global object than the start compartment.
The global object is initially mutable.
Locking down the realm hardened the objects in global scope.
After `lockdown`, no compartment can tamper with these **intrinsics** and
**undeniable** objects.
Many of these are identical in the new compartment.

```js
const c = new Compartment();
c.globalThis === globalThis; // false
c.globalThis.JSON === JSON; // true
```

Other pairs of compartments also share many identical intrinsics and undeniable
objects of the realm.
Each has a unique, initially mutable, global object.

```js
const c1 = new Compartment();
const c2 = new Compartment();
c1.globalThis === c2.globalThis; // false
c1.globalThis.JSON === c2.globalThis.JSON; // true
```

Any code executed within a compartment shares a set of module instances.
For modules to work within a compartment, the creator must provide
a `resolveHook` and an `importHook`.
The `resolveHook` determines how the compartment will infer the full module
specifier for another module from a referrer module and the import specifier.
The `importHook` accepts a full specifier and asynchronously returns a
`ModuleStaticRecord` for that module.

```js
import 'ses';

const c1 = new Compartment({}, {}, {
  resolveHook: (moduleSpecifier, moduleReferrer) => {
    return resolve(moduleSpecifier, moduleReferrer);
  },
  importHook: async moduleSpecifier => {
    const moduleLocation = locate(moduleSpecifier);
    const moduleText = await retrieve(moduleLocation);
    return new ModuleStaticRecord(moduleText, moduleLocation);
  },
});
```

A compartment can also link a module in another compartment.
Each compartment has a `module` function that accepts a module specifier
and returns the module exports namespace for that module.
The module exports namespace is not useful for inspecting the exports of the
module until that module has been imported, but it can be passed into the
module map of another Compartment, creating a link.

```js
const c2 = new Compartment({}, {
  'c1': c1.module('./main.js'),
}, {
  resolveHook,
  importHook,
});
```
